      h2 Model Snippet
      p The model used by TBLC is based on a well-established legal and economic framework. The appraisal methodology adheres to Texas Property Tax Code (PTC) and Supreme Court precedents, focusing on determining the profitability of the inventory in question to estimate its market value. This approach ensures that tax assessments are accurate and legally sound, leading to significant reductions in property tax liabilities for clients. The goal is to determine the most probable price a purchaser would pay for the entire inventory unit, reflecting its true market value.

      h2 Results
      p The table summarizes appraised values from various Texas CADs, ARBs, Arbitrators, SOAH Judge, and Courts, as a percentage of Historical Cost New (HCN). While none of these entities fully embraced the valuation model, they generally accepted or did not oppose its findings due to strong supporting evidence. Many Texas CADs accepted the Good Faith Estimate (GFE) of Market Value (MV) at around 50% of HCN. Over 90% of the cases resulted in accepted or near-GFE values. Some accounts remain pending with settlements expected.
